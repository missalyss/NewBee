NewBee
===========

NewBee is a mobile app that utilizes Internet of Things (among other things) to aide "newbee" beekeepers understand how to care for their hive.

## Internet of Stings

One way that NewBee aids its beekeepers is by keeping it informed with a beehive monitor. A Rasperry Pi, connected to a DHT11, sits in the beehive and continuously posts data to an external API, which is then grabbed by the front-end app.

## Application

Splash page and dashboard. Dashboard connects to user information, NewBee's about page, as well as quick links to recent inspections, new inspections, and monitor sensors.

### Inspections

Instead of exercising or feeding their pet, beekeeper's primary job is to to inspect the hive and make sure everything is healthy. The inspection form is designed to aid the beekeeper in knowing what to look for. It also automatically takes most recent data from monitor and adds it to the post.

### Monitor

The monitor access the posts from the Raspberry Pi and charts the information using Chart.js and Angular-Chart.js.

Charts are available to view by most recent 24 hours, most recent 7 days, 4 weeks, or all data points.

### Bee MD

Bee MD is an external API designed to hold glossary information as well as information on bee health: users can look up symptoms, see potential causes, and possible treatments. Associations are voted on likelihood of association.
